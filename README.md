# Plain simple: Weather

Oh boy... writting the readme... always a pleasure to make a bufoon of me showing my extremely sharp knowledge of UX, design skills and, more than anything, how savy I am on Markdown.

Why hello there, this is a wrapper for current weather on this open API: http://openweathermap.org for an online test.

TODO: Write the docs, prolly this weekend, as it should take wuite some time.
